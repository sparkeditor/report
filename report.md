# Spark Collaborative Editor Final Report
by Jeremy Dormitzer

## Abstract
For my senior project, I decided to build a collaborative text editor in the style of Google Docs. I hoped to make a tool that could support remote pair programming, in the classroom and in the workplace. After drafting an ambitious plan, I pared down the scope of the project to a more realistic level. The final result was a basic web-based text editor with some advanced features and full support for collaborative editing of documents. Although the software I built was not as fully-featured as I had hoped, I considerably advanced my software engineering skills and built a basic product that could be built upon in the future.

## Introduction
For my senior project, I built a web-based collaborative text editor called Spark. My decision to build a pair programming tool was motivated by my experience collaborating with other students on school projects. Although version control tools like `git` or `mercurial` enable collaboration on the project level, they do not offer the ability to collaborate in real time on a single file. Existing tools for real-time collaboration do exist (see the [Background section](#background) for more details); however, these tools have various problems that make them unsuitable or difficult to use. Another major motivation for building Spark was my interest in the open source software movement. I wanted to build a tool that could be developed collectively by an open source community. This influenced my choice of technology - by choosing an all-JavaScript stack, I hoped that more developers would be able to contribute to the project. Unfortunately, I did not end up having time to properly pursue community outreach or repository maintenance (writing a contributing guide, good internal documentation, etc.), so I had to abandon that aspect of the project.
