# Spark Collaborative Editor Final Report
by Jeremy Dormitzer

## Abstract
For my senior project, I decided to build a collaborative text editor in the style of Google Docs. I hoped to make a tool that could support remote pair programming, in the classroom and in the workplace. After drafting an ambitious plan, I pared down the scope of the project to a more realistic level. The final result was a basic web-based text editor with some advanced features and full support for collaborative editing of documents. Although the software I built was not as fully-featured as I had hoped, I considerably advanced my software engineering skills and built a basic product that could be built upon in the future.
